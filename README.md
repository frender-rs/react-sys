# WIP

This crate is NOT ready for production
and is under heavy development.
This crate intends to be used by [`frender`](https://github.com/frender-rs/frender),
which provides a friendly and safe api to use React in rust.

Checkout [alpha](https://github.com/frender-rs/react-sys/tree/alpha#todo) branch
to see more information.
